# Typesense Silverstripe integration

This module:
+ allows programmatic creation of search forms to query a Typesense collection
+ carrying out of Typesense searches on a selected collection
+ provides a consistent data structure for indexing and rendering results
+ allows adding of support Typesense instantsearch to your data models, with configuration within the administration area
+ provides an extension to handle upsert and removal of documents that are marked for indexing

This module does not provide any implementations for searching in your Typesense collections. Use the following modules to implement this:

+ nswdpc/silverstripe-typesense-cms - provides a Typesense page to search and display results from collections
+ nswdpc/silverstripe-typesense-elemental - provides Elemental content blocks to search collections

For NSW users wanting to integrate with the NSW Design System, the module nswdpc/waratah-typesense will assist.
